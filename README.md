Histopathologenic Cancer Detection Project

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify cancerous cells in small image patches from Kaggle's Histopathologic Cancer Detection challenges.

The designed convolutional network analyzes over 220,000 labeled 96x96 pixel RGB images, learning to distinguish cancerous from non-cancerous tissues.
